Markup
======

A plugin for validating XML and formatting XML and HTML. For information on
what the plugin can do, see:

https://github.com/eerohele/markup

To get full benefit of the plugin, you'll probably want to use an XML catalog.

If you already have one or more catalog files, you can tell Markup to use them.
Add an entry like this into User/Markup.sublime-settings:

{
  "xml_catalog_files": [
    "/path/to/my/xml/catalog.xml", "/path/to/my/other/catalog.xml"
  ]
}

NOTE: Every time you modify the "xml_catalog_files" setting, you have to restart
Sublime Text 3 for the changes to take effect.

If you don't have an XML catalog, you can install one by using my
markup-schemas GitHub repository at:

https://github.com/eerohele/markup-schemas

Remember to set the "xml_catalog_files" setting to point to the catalog.xml
in the repo and restart Sublime Text 3.
